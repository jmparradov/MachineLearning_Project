# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project developed as part of the Especializaci√≥n UDEA program. The project aims to explore and implement various machine learning algorithms to find the best model to predict the noise levels, based on specific variables related to the streets measures and cars' average speed.
